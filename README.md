Lab 1 - Video Synchronization
=====

### Introduction

The purpose of this laboratory exercise was to write a video controller for use with an FPGA. The FPGA was programmed using VHDL code to interface with a VGA-to-HDMI cable.


### Implementation

The implementation of this lab consisted of having to write code for five separate VHDL modules, with each module performing its specific function. A block diagram/RTL schematic of my design can be seen in the image below:

The modules that I wrote for this lab are listed below complete with examples and explanations:
 1. `atlys_lab_video`
 2. `h_sync_gen`
 3. `v_sync_gen`
 4. `vga_sync`
 5. `pixel_gen`
